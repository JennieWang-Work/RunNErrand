### Project Description:
- RunNErrand is a Web App that not only provides opportunities to students who want to earn some extra cash by connecting with others in their community but also offers assistance to those students who need help with daily errands or other issues. With this app, students can either post tasks or accept the most suitable jobs for them by filtering the locations. 
### Product Vision Statement:
- Create and manage one’s own accounts (including contact details and profile photos) on the platform.
- Allow users to post tasks, browse available tasks, and accept tasks.
- The ability for users to view currently scheduled tasks, and past completed/canceled tasks.
- The ability for users to make and receive payment for completed tasks.

### The start of RunNErrand:
- The inspiration comes from our idea to provide a more secure and convenient environment to solve students’ life troubles. We get a feeling that some students are craving opportunities to earn more pocket money while others are struggling by the troubling errand and really need help(totally fine by paying money to do that ). So we provide such a terrace to fulfill both types of students’ needs with a negotiable price. And we believe that is meaningful.
