## Guide to Contributing

### How To Run Our Web App: 
* Go to our back-end directory, run via command lines 'npm install' -> 'npm start'. 
* Then direct to the front-end directory, run 'npm install' -> 'npm start'. 
* In order to have information stored, Robo 3T needs to be open and connected to the database, which is pinned in our slack channel. 

### Project Values:
RunNErrand’s value is to support college students to alleviate financial burden; and to create a community for students outside classrooms. 
 
### Team Norms：
* Keep ideas original and creative.
* Effectively contribute to assigned tasks.
* Trust each other.
* Respect each other and be open minded to others’ opinions.
* Stand-ups two times a week: One hour before class on Monday and Wednesday.
 
### Git Workflow：
* Make sure to `git pull` before doing any actual work on the local repository to see if there are any new changes made by other teammates.
* Create a new branch `git branch BranchName`, switch to the new branch `git checkout BranchName`, and modify all the changes under the branch.
* After finishing the work each time, make sure to `git add . `, `git commit -m “____”`, so that each change will be explicitly recorded. 
* After finishing any work, notify the product owner and other team members in slack or other communication channels. 
* Every time a teammate makes any new changes, the product owner and the team members should review the new changes and give some comments of whether the new changes are good enough to be added and merged to the main branch. 
* Make sure to pull again before adding and committing new changes.
* After discussion and modification has been done, the member can make a pull request.
* The product owner will decide whether to accept the pull request or not.

### Rules of Contributing
* Discuss any new ideas/features that will be worked on with every team member in stand-up meetings before doing any actual work.
* After making any changes, the contributor must commit and push all the work into a branch first, and then issue a pull re	quest.
* To ensure the integrity of the project, any pull request must be validated and merged by the Product Owner. 
 
### To Resolve Disagreements
* Every member in the team has the equal right to express their opinions about the project. 
* When disagreements or conflicts arise, members who have different suggestions should speak one by one, and all the other members should listen respectfully and quietly. 
* After all different opinions are expressed, every member should consider all opinions seriously
* To make the final decision of the disagreements or conflicts, we decide to follow the mechanism of voting
 
### Development Environment
This project will presumably be written in java. In order to set up this environment, one needs to download a text editor. The programs will be run through UNIX systems. 

### Building and Testing
* Write the functions needed in the program based on distinct functionalities. 
* Test the functions separately and collectively, to solve any logic errors. 
* Debugging after the main function is completed and run-able.
